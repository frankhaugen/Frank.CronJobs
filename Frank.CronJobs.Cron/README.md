# Frank.CronJobs.Cron

This is based on CronQuery, which I am a contributor to. This is a fork of that code that concerns the cron expression part of the code.

I have added some documentation and I intend to "lock" the code to the current state in this library, because I just want a no frills cron expression parser.
